# [Imitategram](https://imitategram.vercel.app/)

Designing a decent, useful app is a tough task, and I needed an off-shelf well-designed app to implement to outsource the design task. I did some research and decided to go for Instagram.

I decided to document this experience, the lessons I learned, the challenges I faced. Naturally, I underestimated the size of this undertaking, and Instagram turned out to be full of UI quirks and difficulties.

I called it `Imitategram` because of Google Safe Browsing. Google Safe Browsing flags your site if it looks too similar to a popular site to prevent phishing. So, I had to rename the app and added a disclaimer when you first visit the app.
